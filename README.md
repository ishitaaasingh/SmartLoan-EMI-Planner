is the website  SmartLoan EMI Planner is a modern web based loan calculator that helps users understand their loan repayments clearly before making any financial decision. 

How it is built

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML is used to create the structure of the app, including the input fields and result cards.
CSS is used to design the modern card layout, colors, and spacing.
JavaScript handles all the loan calculations and updates the values in real time when the user clicks the calculate button.

The EMI calculation follows real world banking formulas, which makes the results realistic and reliable.

Why this project is useful

Most people only look at the EMI when taking a loan, but they do not realize how much interest they will pay over time. This tool makes that clear by showing both the monthly payment and the total cost of the loan in a simple way. It can be used for education loans, personal loans, and home loans.
